# CLAUDE.md — MLB Bayesian Projection & Matchup System

## Project Overview
A hierarchical Bayesian projection system for MLB player performance, with a game-level pitcher-batter matchup model that powers both front-office-grade analytics and betting-actionable K prop predictions. Built by The Data Diamond (Koa).

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Bayesian Modeling:** PyMC 5.x, ArviZ for diagnostics
- **Data:** PostgreSQL (existing database with Statcast pitch-level + boxscore data, 2018-2025)
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy
- **ML/Evaluation:** scikit-learn (calibration curves, metrics), XGBoost (optional Stuff+ layer)
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **API:** MLB Stats API (pybaseball or custom queries for supplemental data)
- **Environment:** Docker (existing setup), conda or venv

## Database Context
Koa has an existing PostgreSQL database (`mlb_fantasy` on `localhost:5433`) containing:
- **Statcast pitch-level data** (2018-2025, 5.4M pitches): Every pitch with velocity, movement (pfx_x, pfx_z), release point, spin rate, spin axis, plate location (plate_x, plate_z), extension, pitch type, outcome (description field), batter/pitcher IDs
- **Batted ball data** (483K): Exit velo, launch angle, xwOBA, xBA, xSLG, spray, hard_hit, barrel flags
- **Boxscore data** (2018-2025): Game-level stats, plate appearances, strikeouts, walks, innings pitched, pitch counts
- **Star schema layout:** `production.fact_pitch`, `production.fact_pa`, `production.sat_batted_balls`, `production.sat_pitch_shape`, `production.dim_player`, `production.dim_game`, `production.dim_team`, plus `staging.*` and `raw.*` upstream tables
- Key column names: `release_speed`, `pfx_x`, `pfx_z`, `plate_x`, `plate_z`, `release_spin_rate`, `pitch_type`, `events`, `description`, `batter_id`, `pitcher_id`, `game_pk`, `game_counter`
- Pre-computed boolean flags on `fact_pitch`: `is_whiff`, `is_swing`, `is_called_strike`, `is_bip`, `is_foul`

**IMPORTANT:** Before writing any SQL or data loading code, inspect the actual database schema first:
```bash
psql -U <user> -d <dbname> -c "\dt"  # list tables
psql -U <user> -d <dbname> -c "\d <tablename>"  # describe columns
```
Do NOT assume table or column names — verify them.

## Architecture: Three-Layer System

### Layer 1: Season-Level Bayesian Projections (PyMC)
**Purpose:** Estimate true-talent rates for pitchers and hitters with proper uncertainty.

**Target stats (hitters):** K%, BB%, Barrel%, xwOBA
**Target stats (pitchers):** K%, BB%, HR/9, xwOBA-against

**Model structure:**
- Hierarchical partial pooling across players (shrink small samples toward population)
- Gaussian random walk for year-to-year talent evolution
- Aging curve as population-level covariate (polynomial or spline in age)
- Statcast skill indicators as informative priors (exit velo, barrel rate, whiff rate inform the talent prior beyond just observed outcomes)
- Binomial/Beta observation model for rate stats
- Output: Full posterior distributions per player per stat, not just point estimates

### Layer 2: Pitch-Type Matchup Model
**Purpose:** Quantify how a pitcher's arsenal maps onto a hitter's vulnerabilities AND strengths.

**Hitter vulnerability profile (per batter, per pitch type):**
- Whiff rate (swings & misses / total swings)
- Chase rate (swings at pitches outside zone / pitches outside zone)
- CSW% (called strikes + whiffs / total pitches)
- These are partially pooled via the Bayesian model to handle small samples

**Hitter strength profile (per batter, per pitch type):**
- Barrel rate on contact
- xwOBA on contact
- Hard-hit rate (exit velo >= 95 mph)
- Pull% and spray angle distribution (shows WHERE they crush it)
- These feed content (hitter strength cards) and can inform pitcher avoidance strategy

**Pitcher arsenal profile (per pitcher, per pitch type):**
- Usage rate
- Pitch-level whiff rate
- Pitch-level barrel rate against
- Typical location heatmap (zone distribution)

**Matchup calculation:**
```
For each (pitcher, batter) pair:
    For each pitch_type in pitcher.arsenal:
        k_contribution = pitcher.usage[pt] * hitter.whiff_vuln[pt] * pitcher.whiff_quality[pt]
        damage_risk = pitcher.usage[pt] * hitter.strength[pt] * (1 - pitcher.whiff_quality[pt])
    matchup_k_score = sum(k_contributions) vs baseline
    matchup_damage_score = sum(damage_risks) vs baseline
```

**Sample size handling:** Hierarchical partial pooling. Pitch types with few observations shrink toward:
1. The hitter's overall whiff/damage tendency
2. The population average for that pitch type
3. Correlated pitch types (sliders inform cutters, changeups inform splitters)

### Layer 3: Game-Level K Prediction
**Purpose:** Produce a full posterior distribution over a pitcher's K total for a specific game.

**Inputs:**
- Pitcher's true-talent K% (from Layer 1 posterior)
- Each lineup batter's pitch-type vulnerability profile (from Layer 2)
- Projected innings / pitch count (from historical workload patterns in boxscores)
- Park factor (minor adjustment)
- Handedness composition of lineup vs pitcher

**Output:**
- Posterior distribution over total Ks
- P(over X.5) for direct comparison to sportsbook lines
- Matchup-specific K probabilities per batter (for hitter K prop bets)

## Key Design Principles

1. **Bayesian everything.** Use posterior distributions, not point estimates. Uncertainty quantification is the differentiator for front offices AND for bet sizing (Kelly criterion needs probability estimates).

2. **Partial pooling over arbitrary filters.** Never use hard minimum PA cutoffs to filter data. Let the hierarchical model shrink small samples toward priors. This uses ALL available data.

3. **Statcast informs priors, not just features.** A hitter's barrel rate and exit velo should inform the PRIOR on their xwOBA talent, not just be a feature in a regression. This is the edge over public projection systems.

4. **Separation of concerns.** Season projections, matchup profiles, and game predictions are separate modules that compose together. Each is independently testable and valuable.

5. **Cache aggressively.** Pitch-level queries are expensive. Feature-engineered tables should be cached as Parquet files with clear date stamps. Rebuild only when new data arrives.

6. **Branding consistency.** All visualizations use The Data Diamond color palette:
   - Primary: Hawaiian flag colors — Red (#C8102E), Yellow (#FFD700), Green (#006B3F)
   - Background: Dark (#1a1a2e) or clean white depending on platform
   - Font: Clean sans-serif, no clutter
   - Every chart gets a "The Data Diamond" watermark

## Coding Standards

- **Python 3.11+**, type hints on all function signatures
- **Docstrings** on all public functions (numpy style)
- **No notebooks for production code.** Notebooks are for EDA and model development only. All reusable code goes in `src/`.
- **SQL queries** live in `src/data/queries.py` as functions that return DataFrames. No raw SQL strings scattered through the codebase.
- **PyMC models** are built inside functions that return the model and trace, making them testable and reproducible. Always set `random_seed` for reproducibility.
- **Logging** over print statements. Use `logging` module.
- **Config** via YAML files, not hardcoded values. DB credentials, league average constants, model hyperparameters all go in config.

## Evaluation Requirements

Every model must be evaluated with:
1. **Walk-forward backtesting:** Train on data through season N, predict season N+1, roll forward. Never leak future data.
2. **Calibration curves:** Do 80% credible intervals contain the truth ~80% of the time?
3. **Brier score:** For binary outcomes derived from continuous projections.
4. **Benchmark vs Marcel:** Season projections must beat the Marcel system (weighted 5/4/3 recent seasons, regressed to mean, age-adjusted). If they don't, something is wrong.
5. **Betting ROI tracking:** Simulated and live bet tracking with Kelly sizing.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Do NOT use `description` field for whiff detection without checking all values.** Statcast's `description` column has many possible values (swinging_strike, swinging_strike_blocked, foul_tip, etc.). Define whiff/chase/called_strike mappings explicitly in `constants.py`.
- **Do NOT treat pitch_type as static.** Pitchers add/drop pitches across seasons. The model must handle pitchers whose arsenal changes.
- **Do NOT ignore platoon splits.** Build L/R handedness into matchup profiles from the start.
- **Do NOT run PyMC on the full dataset during development.** Sample on a subset of players first, verify convergence (r_hat, ESS, divergences), then scale up.
- **Do NOT forget to regress.** Raw observed rates are not true talent. The entire point of the Bayesian model is regression to the mean with proper uncertainty.

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Data Foundation
1. [x] Verify database connection and inspect schema
2. [x] Build and cache pitch-type aggregation tables (hitter and pitcher profiles)
3. [ ] Data QA sanity reports (denominator consistency, row count validation, anomaly flags)
4. [ ] League baselines v2: extend `compute_league_baselines` with **batter_stand splits** and **pitch archetype** granularity
5. [ ] Pitch archetype clustering from `sat_pitch_shape` (velo, pfx_x, pfx_z, spin_rate, extension) — feeds baselines AND Layer 2

### Phase 2: Layer 1 — Season Talent Models
6. [x] Hitter K% hierarchical Bayesian model (PyMC, binomial, random walk, Statcast covariates)
7. [ ] Add **platoon split** (batter_stand) as hierarchical factor to hitter K% model
8. [ ] Pitcher K% model (mirror hitter model using `pitcher_season_totals`; separate whiff skill vs contact suppression as covariates)
9. [ ] Add **starter/reliever role** flag to pitcher model (derive from IP/game in boxscores)
10. [ ] Run walk-forward backtest, verify convergence, confirm beats Marcel

### Phase 3: Layer 2 — Matchup Model
11. [ ] Matchup scoring module: pitch-archetype × hitter vulnerability (logit/additive, start with whiff/K)
12. [ ] Validate matchup lift over "no-matchup" baseline on game Ks

### Phase 4: Layer 3 — Game K Posterior
13. [ ] Workload / BF distribution model (predict BF by role, team, season)
14. [ ] Game K posterior: combine K% posterior + matchup adjustment + BF distribution
15. [ ] Produce P(over X.5) and calibration

### Phase 5: Expansion & Content
16. [ ] Expand targets: BB%, HR, xwOBA on contact
17. [ ] Betting edge finder and tracker (Kelly sizing)
18. [ ] Content visualizations (matchup cards, hitter strength profiles)

## Advanced Feature Triage

Features from `docs/advanced_projection_features.md` evaluated for signal vs complexity.
Only features that add incremental value beyond what the hierarchical Bayesian model already provides are prioritized.

### Build (integrated into checklist above)
- **Pitch archetype clustering** (Phase 1, step 5) — clusters pitches by shape (velo, movement, spin, extension) rather than just pitch_type label. Feeds league baselines, Layer 2 matchup model, and content. High value.
- **Contact suppression vs whiff skill separation** (Phase 2, step 8) — already implicit in pitcher profiles (whiff_rate vs barrel_rate_against). Make explicit as separate covariates in pitcher K% model.
- **Role adjustment** (Phase 2, step 9) — starter/reliever distinction. Critical for workload model and prevents overestimating reliever talent.

### Defer (real signal, but handled by model structure or needed later)
- **Stabilized contact quality** (rolling xwOBA windows, variance) — partial pooling + multi-season random walk already captures this. Revisit for in-season updating.
- **Plate discipline stability** (chase rate deltas) — already computed per pitch type. Rolling stability metrics add value for in-season, not season-level.
- **Velocity trend acceleration** — real signal for in-season and injury risk. Not needed for season-level projections where random walk handles year-to-year shifts.

### Skip (low incremental value for this architecture)
- **Aging curve delta** — the random walk IS the aging adjustment. Computing a population aging curve to derive deltas feeds derived noise into the model.
- **Pitch sequencing entropy** — thin evidence of predictive power at season level. Observed whiff/chase rates already capture the downstream effect.
- **Park/environment normalization** — minimal effect on K predictions (primary target). Revisit only if expanding to HR/xwOBA targets.
- **Player similarity embeddings** — hierarchical model already borrows strength across players via population prior. Nearest-neighbor comps are better for content than projections.

## Key Findings
- The sat_batted_balls.xwoba column has IEEE NaN float values (not SQL NULL), which poison PostgreSQL's AVG(). All queries use CASE WHEN xwoba != 'NaN' to handle this.
